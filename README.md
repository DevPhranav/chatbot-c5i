# GPT-3.5 Powered Chatbot in Flutter

This is a Flutter-based chatbot application powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). The app enables users to communicate with an AI chatbot in real time, using the `dash_chat_2` package for the chat UI and the `chat_gpt_sdk` package for interacting with OpenAI's API.

## Features

- **Real-time Chat**: Send and receive messages between the user and GPT-3.5.
- **Customizable UI**: The app uses `dash_chat_2` to provide a rich chat interface.
- **AI Assistant**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to provide AI responses based on user input.
